Network Engineer finding interesting the network automation

## üë®‚Äçüíª About me

Experienced Network Engineer with a proven track record since 2012 in managing and optimizing large-scale network environments, including Service Providers and Cloud Providers. I specialize in the deployment of complex networking solutions and leading technical teams across expansive regions and I have gained experience in network design for large-scale networks.

I have also experienced doing Linux networking by using comidity hardwar where a [DentOs](https://dent.dev/) image was loaded and I had to design, deploy, and troubleshoot interacting with the Linux terminal and the network applications like FRR, iptables, keepalive, dhcp, strongswan, and in-house agents to interact with the ZTP and CI/CD tooling.

While working with cloud providers, I have expanded my skills to network automation where I leverage technologies like Git, Python, APIs, Linux, CI/CD, and DevOps practices to streamline and enhance network operations.

Beyond my core networking skills, I'm deeply passionate about exploring the synergy between network automation and web development. Specifically, working on an idea to develop a Network as a Code project using Pydantic and presenting the data with Astro JS.

## üìö Professional Experience

### ![Microsoft](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQE88xCsONDULQ/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1630652622688/microsoft_logo?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=cXVZCE8mOgVaEaaKyfowShM37-NEhqJEOr76Lys85q8) Senior Cloud Network Engineer at Microsoft (since Feb 28th 2025)

I am part of the Azure WAN IP engineering team that onboards new hardware or design used to build/improve the backbone network for Azure Cloud services. The activities include onboarding new devices, line cards, or code to the network by doing the required tests to ensure seamless integration with the production network. Once the definitions/tests are done, we also define the process to roll out the new hardware/feature via automation, which implies the update or creation of workflows to perform a safe deployment.

- **NDE at Amazon Just Walk Out stores engineering team**: Responsible for evaluating customer needs, designing feature implementations, and ensuring seamless integration with systems that manage configuration updates. Leveraged experience with Linux-based network devices and significantly enhanced coding and automation skills, particularly in Python. Collaborated with Software Engineers to define the logic for agents that help to enable ZTP, automated deployments, and device telemetry.
- **NDE at AWS DX deployment Team**: Facilitated new DX customer connections to the cloud by deploying routing and switching devices (Juniper/Cisco) using AWS automation tools, adhering to a Change Management process, and customizing automation tools for new use cases to enhance operational efficiency. Collaborated through GIT Repositories to develop and approve configuration changes, document changes to deployment runbooks, and use simple Python scripts for routine tasks that boost team productivity.

Performed deployment tasks to build a green field MPLS Network used to migrate all traffic from Data Centers and Branches of a big financial firm. The activities were focused to build a complex network based on Cisco ASR9K and ASR1K devices for the MPLS core using multiple international circuits. The activities need close interaction with Cisco and the bank Engineering Team to review and give feedback to the design so based on that I was creating the activities for deployment. Once the deployment was completed and tested I worked on the migration of the core network and later the migration of the existing branches as well.

During this role, I gained experience with Python automation, initially for simple config rendering and later for automating checks during maintenance windows. I expanded my knowledge by learning two new technologies: Segment Routing and MACsec. I continued to reinforce my understanding of routing protocols

I worked as a Onsite Engineer for a large Service Provider in Mexico. My role was to advice the customer in changes they planned to do, review the MOPs and be in the MW to troubleshoot if needed. Additionally, during customer‚Äôs network issues, I helped the Cisco TAC to identify the issues based on my knowledge of the network and help to explain the reasons of the outages in the network. I was able to learn about Service Provider platforms like ASR9K and Data Center platforms like Nexus9000 which increased my knowledge of technologies/protocols like OSPF, BGP, PIM, IGMP, MPLS L3VPN/L2VPN, Multicast VPNs

Performed deployment activities to maintain the network capacity for the bank Data Centers by using the defined change management process to perform MW where I needed to prepare the configurations, define validations, define rollback for changes and ensure physical requirements are completed to accomplish the work. Worked with Juniper and Cisco switches and routers using protocols/technologies like MPLS, LDP, BGP, OSPF, EIGRP, HSRP, STP, LACP. Given my commitment and willingness to learn, the leadership decided to give me the project to deploy a small Data Center in Texas. My challenge at that moment was the language and the big number of devices to implement.
