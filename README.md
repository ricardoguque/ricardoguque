## üìà Private Projects

### Network as a Code (NAC)

With an organization, I defined a way to automate how the network is defined and then all systems are updated based on that, including monitoring systems, APIs, and the network devices themselves. The solution is being used, but we are still in a phase of audit where we need to ensure that what is defined is indeed what is implemented.

Technologies Used:
- Python with Pydantic for data validation
- Supabase to generate an API for Network engineers and other systems, also used for future metrics
- GitHub Actions for testing, validating ingressed data, and deploying to multiple systems

### Network Monitoring

I decided to use Zabbix for monitoring since it's free and has many features. This system is tied to the NAC pipeline where any change on the intended network will be reflected in Zabbix. For example, an add/update/remove of a network device will be reflected in the monitoring system.

Technologies Used:
- Python and Zabbix API for system updates

### Network API

This project is part of the second phase of the Network as a Code project, which will include metrics. The plan is for devices to have a script and a way to post their metrics directly to Supabase. In some cases, we will need to audit or configure the devices, so an external GitHub action can interact with the API and configure the devices.

Technologies Used:
- Python with FastAPI and Supabase

## üåê Networking Expertise

As a seasoned Network Engineer with over 10 years of experience, I specialize in designing, implementing, and troubleshooting complex network infrastructures. My expertise covers a wide range of networking technologies and protocols, including Cisco, Juniper, and MikroTik devices, as well as advanced protocols such as MPLS, BGP, OSPF, L3VPN, L2VPN, Multicast, and Ethernet.
