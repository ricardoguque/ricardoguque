## What is ARP

When a device is connected to a physical network it does not have a database of the IP to MAC address mapping. It needs to know how to build the Ethernet frame and encapsulate the IP packet on it. This is done by using the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).

ARP is a protocol that works on the L2 layer, it is not routable and only works on the same broadcast domain. 

:::note
ARP can operate with other data link protocols as Ethernet but in this document we will be using Ethernet as the data link protocol.
:::

## When ARP is used

1. When a device needs to send a IP packet to another device on the same broadcast domain, it needs to know the MAC address of the destination device. 
2. When a device needs to send a IP packet to another device on a different broadcast domain, it needs to know the MAC address of the default gateway.

## ARP process
<Steps>
1. The device A sends a ARP request to the broadcast address asking for the MAC address of the destination IP address.
2. The device B that has the destination IP address will respond unicast with a ARP reply with its MAC address.
3. The device A that sent the ARP request will receive the ARP reply and will update its ARP table with the IP to MAC address mapping.
4. The device A will then send the IP packet to the destination MAC address.
5. The device A or B can continue sending ARP requests to refresh the ARP cache but in this case it will be unicast to the other device
6. The device A or B will respond with a ARP reply with its MAC address and will update its ARP table.
</Steps>


After the ARP process is completed, each device continues sending ARP requests 

## ARP Messages in action

Lets use the following example to understand the 2 ARP messages request and reply. I force a Ubuntu server to send an ARP request to a host in same boradcast domain by clearing the ARP cache.

<Steps>
1. Identify the ARP entry before clearing the ARP cache
    ```bash
    richo@richo-HCAR5000-MI:~$ arp -n | grep 172.16.1.69
    172.16.1.69              ether   14:eb:b6:b0:e2:bc   C                     enp3s0
    ```
2. Identify the MAC and IP of our interface to help understanding a packet capture
    ```bash
    richo@richo-HCAR5000-MI:~$ sudo ip add show enp3s0 | grep -E "172.16.1.31|ether"
        link/ether c8:ff:bf:00:e8:d9 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet 172.16.1.31/24 brd 172.16.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp3s0
    ```
3. Start a packet capture to match the ARP packets
    ```bash
    richo@richo-HCAR5000-MI:~$ sudo tcpdump -n host 172.16.1.69 and arp
    tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode
    listening on enp3s0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes
    ```
4. Delete the ARP entry for ip 172.100.100.2, confirm is deleted and send a pinc to force ARP
    ```bash
    richo@richo-HCAR5000-MI:~$ sudo arp -d 172.16.1.69; arp -n | grep 172.16.1.69; ping 172.16.1.69 -c 2
    PING 172.16.1.69 (172.16.1.69) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 172.16.1.69: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.666 ms
    64 bytes from 172.16.1.69: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.348 ms

    --- 172.16.1.69 ping statistics ---
    2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 1048ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.348/0.507/0.666/0.159 ms
    ```
5. Check the packet capture and see the initial request/reply and the request/reply to refresh the ARP cache
    ```bash
    17:15:53.496363 c8:ff:bf:00:e8:d9 > ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 42: Request who-has 172.16.1.69 tell 172.16.1.31, length 28
    17:15:53.496682 14:eb:b6:b0:e2:bc > c8:ff:bf:00:e8:d9, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 60: Reply 172.16.1.69 is-at 14:eb:b6:b0:e2:bc, length 46
    17:16:03.838558 14:eb:b6:b0:e2:bc > c8:ff:bf:00:e8:d9, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 60: Request who-has 172.16.1.31 tell 172.16.1.69, length 46
    17:16:03.838575 c8:ff:bf:00:e8:d9 > 14:eb:b6:b0:e2:bc, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 42: Reply 172.16.1.31 is-at c8:ff:bf:00:e8:d9, length 28
    ```
</Steps>

## ARP headers
The ARP header is 28 bytes long and contains the fields described on the table below:
| Field Name              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware type (2 bytes) | Type of hardware used (Ethernet, Token Ring, etc.)                          |
| Protocol type (2 bytes) | Type of protocol used (IPv4, IPv6, etc.)                                   |
| Hardware length (1 byte)  | Length of the hardware address (usually 6 bytes for Ethernet)         |
| Protocol length (1 byte)  | Length of the protocol address (usually 4 bytes for IPv4)             |
| Protocol length (1 byte)  |                                    |
| Operation (2 bytes)     | Type of ARP message (request or reply)                                      |
| Sender hardware address (6 bytes) | Hardware address of the sender (MAC address)                      |
| Sender protocol address (4 bytes) | Protocol address of the sender (IPv4 address)                      |
| Target hardware address (6 bytes) | Hardware address of the target (MAC address)                      |
| Target protocol address (4 bytes) | Protocol address of the target (IPv4 address)                      |

For example with the capture done in the former example we can see the following for the 4 frames:

:::caution
For the unicast request from 14:eb:b6:b0:e2:bc to c8:ff:bf:00:e8:d9, even when the Ethernet header shows is unicast the ARP message shows the `Target MAC address: 00:00:00:00:00:00`, this is seems to be something not standard but used to reduce ARP messages in the network

## ARP table/cache

The ARP table is a cache that stores the IP to MAC address mapping. The ARP table is used to speed up the ARP process and reduce the number of ARP requests sent on the network.

The following are examples of the ARP table on different devices:

```bash title="Linux ARP table"
richo@richo-HCAR5000-MI:~$ arp -n
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface

172.16.1.56                      (incomplete)                              enp3s0
172.100.100.2            ether   02:42:ac:64:64:02   C                     br-a48aa2668b65
172.100.100.3            ether   02:42:ac:64:64:03   C                     br-a48aa2668b65
172.16.1.116             ether   44:a3:bb:3c:9e:70   C                     enp3s0
172.100.100.6            ether   02:42:ac:64:64:06   C                     br-a48aa2668b65
172.100.100.4            ether   02:42:ac:64:64:04   C                     br-a48aa2668b65
172.16.1.69              ether   14:eb:b6:b0:e2:bc   C                     enp3s0
172.16.1.1               ether   d4:b9:2f:4d:31:42   C                     wlp2s0
```
```bash title="Arista ARP table"
r1#show ip arp
Address         Age (sec)  Hardware Addr   Interface
172.100.100.1     0:00:00  0242.3b04.4e73  Management0
172.100.100.6     0:00:04  0242.ac64.6406  Management0
```

To avoid having stale entries in the ARP table 2 ways can be implemented:
- Timeout: to define how long the entry will be kept in the ARP table. The timeout is different per OS, for example in Linux the default is 60 seconds and in Windows is 2 minutes.
- Refresh: to refresh the ARP table every certain time. This is done by sending a ARP request to the IP address in the ARP table. 

## Proxy ARP

This is a technique used by routers to respond to ARP requests on behalf of other devices located on a different network (broadcast domain). 

The use cases are not very common and it is avoided so I will not fucus much on this.

## Gratuitous ARP

This happends when a device sends an ARP request to the broadcast address asking for its own IP address. This is used to update the ARP table of other devices on the network with the MAC address of the sender.

The message does not expect a reply but if someoen reply to the ARP request that also can be used to know someone else already have the IP address.

Use cases:
- In the FHR (First Hop Redundancy) protocols like HSRP, VRRP, GLBP to inform the other devices of the new active router.
- In cluster servers to inform the other devices of the new active server.
- In some network OS after enabling a interface it sends a GARP so the devices in the network update/add the entry in their table.

The following is an example of a GARP message:
```bash title="GARP message"
Ethernet II, Src: 02:42:ac:64:64:02 (02:42:ac:64:64:02), Dst: Broadcast (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)
