Welcome to my personal website where I share notes and insights on various topics I've read or studied. Some of these notes are from past experiences, though unfortunately, some have been lost over time.

I've been experimenting with [Astro](https://astro.build/) for fun projects and recently discovered [Starlight](https://starlight). for documentation purposes. This inspired me to create a personal website using these tools, with the hope that my documentation will be helpful to others in their searches.

## Contents

My plan is to compile notes on the following topics, which I use in my day-to-day work and have a keen interest in:
- **Networking**: Detailed notes on networking concepts, protocols, and best practices.
- **How-To Guides**: Practical guides on tools and technologies I use regularly.
- **Network Automation**: Insights and techniques for automating network tasks.
- **Network Observability**: Methods and tools for monitoring and analyzing network performance.

Feel free to explore and I hope you find the information useful!
